Today we had the last meeting of the 3-day course with hands-on approach on [Python For the Lab](https://www.pythonforthelab.com/). The course was a tremendous success, we learned new tools and tricks to control our state-of-the-art experiments with the computer using [Python](https://www.python.org/). The  course was provided by the company [Uetke](https://www.uetke.com/) and the trainer, Aquiles Carattino, has shared with us his experience building instruments for research laboratories, from the lowest level all the way to GUI design. Now it is time to use this in our experiments!
