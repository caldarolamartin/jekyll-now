I am very proud to congratulate Dr. Weichun Zhang for his PhD defense today! 
 
After 4 long years of hard work at the lab, Weichun defended successfully his PhD today. I was my honor supervise him, share long hours in the lab and to learn so many interesting facts about gold nanorods and fluorescence enhancement. Now he will continue his career as a postdoc. All the best in your next position!
