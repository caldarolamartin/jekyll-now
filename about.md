I am an experimental physicist working in the nanophotonics field. I enjoy developing state-of-the-art photonics tools to solve biophysical problems. 

Since July 2018, I am a [Kavli postdoctoral fellow](http://kavli.tudelft.nl/kavli-postdoctoral-fellowships/) at the [Kavli Institute of Nanoscience Delft (KIND)](http://kavli.tudelft.nl/) at the [Technical University Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/), The Netherlands. Here I work in a collaborative project between the [Kuipers lab](http://kuiperslab.tudelft.nl/pages/kuipers/) at the [Quantum Nanoscience Department](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/faculty-of-applied-sciences/about-faculty/departments/quantum-nanoscience/) (QN) and the [Aubin-Tam Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/aubintamgroup/) at the [Bionanoscience department](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/faculty-of-applied-sciences/about-faculty/departments/bionanoscience/) (BN). The project aims combine state-of-the-art nanophotonic structures and tailored light fields to develop a new label-free single-molecule optical method. With this new method we aim to study protein (un)folding dynamics.

I studied physics at the [Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences](https://exactas.uba.ar/) at the [University of Buenos Aires](http://www.uba.ar/), Argentina. I did my PhD at the [Quantum Electronics Laboratory](http://www.lec.df.uba.ar/en), at the same University, where I developed a home-made combined optical microscope with an atomic force microscope. With this setup, I studied optical and thermal properties of novel dielectric nanoantennas and mechanotransduction in live cells. I got my PhD in 2015 from the University of Buenos Aires and then I moved to Michel Orritâ€™s group, [Single-molecule Optics](http://www.single-molecule.nl), at [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en) as a post-doc. During my stay in Leiden, I studied single-molecule fluorescence enhancement by individual gold nanorods and its applications, for example, to study single-molecule electrochemistry.



My hobbies are playing tennis and training triathlon. I particularly outdoors activities and Mediterranean food.
